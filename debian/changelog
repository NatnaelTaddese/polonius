polonius (0.3) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Patched a bug which prevented polonius-editor
  from obtaining file descriptors on files larger
  than 2GB when running on 32-bit systems
  Previously, this bug caused a segfault on
  trying to open large files on 32-bit systems

polonius (0.1) bullseye; urgency=low

  * Initial release
  polonius-reader and polonius-editor
