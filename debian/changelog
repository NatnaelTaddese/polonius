polonius (0.5.8) stable; urgency=medium

  * More sanity checks on block size inputs
    Block sizes are now stored as 64-bit integers, and there are more
    checks in place to ensure valid input. This closes #30
  * Fixed problem with stack overflows in regex searches
    The standard library's regex search function is recursive and has
    potential to overflow the stack, particularly when searching very
    large documents (in fact the *point* of polonius) This was documented
    before it was fully understood in Github issue #29
    To fix it, polonius-reader is now compiled with -fsplit-stack.
    This option allows a discontiguous stack which grows automatically
    as needed

polonius (0.5.7) stable; urgency=medium

  * Patched a bug with 'remove' instructions
    Previously, remove instructions didn't work properly with the 'end'
    keyword. That has now been fixed in this change. This closes #26

polonius (0.5.1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Polonius-reader now exits with
  a non-zero exit code if a search
  was unsuccessful

 -- rail5 <andrew@rail5.org>  Thu, 24 Aug 2023 16:15:04 -0400

polonius (0.5) stable; urgency=medium

  * Polonius-reader is now capable of
  performing regex searches. The fact
  that this is possible is a miracle as
  far as I'm concerned.
  The regex support isn't perfect, and
  may fail from time to time while I'm
  patching out any bugs.
  A regex search can be performed by
  passing the -e option when doing a
  search.
  With this addition, I believe that
  polonius-reader and polonius-editor
  are essentially feature-complete.
